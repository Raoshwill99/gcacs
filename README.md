# Decentralized Governance with Anti-Corruption Safeguards

## Project Overview

This project implements a decentralized governance system on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The core innovation of this system is the integration of anti-corruption mechanisms designed to detect and prevent manipulation or concentration of voting power in decision-making processes.

### Key Features

- Proposal creation and voting system
- Automatic finalization of proposals
- Built-in safeguards against voting manipulation
- Transparent and verifiable voting process

## Smart Contract Structure

The main contract, `governance-contract.clar`, contains the following key components:

1. Data structures for proposals and votes
2. Functions for creating proposals
3. Voting mechanism
4. Proposal finalization process
5. Initial anti-corruption measures

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarity VS Code extension (recommended)

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Deploy the contract using the Stacks CLI:

```bash
stacks deploy governance-contract.clar
```

## Usage

### Creating a Proposal

To create a proposal, call the `create-proposal` function with a title and description. Ensure you have the minimum required STX balance.

### Voting

Users can vote on active proposals using the `vote` function, specifying the proposal ID and their vote ("yes" or "no").

### Finalizing Proposals

Once the voting period has ended, anyone can call the `finalize-proposal` function to conclude the voting process and determine the outcome.

## Anti-Corruption Measures

The current implementation includes basic anti-corruption measures:

- Minimum threshold for proposal creation
- One vote per address per proposal
- Placeholder for voting power analysis (to be expanded)

Future iterations will enhance these measures to provide more robust protection against voting manipulation.

## Development Roadmap

1. Initial implementation (current stage)
2. Enhanced anti-corruption mechanisms
3. Improved voting system with quadratic voting
4. Integration with external data sources for voter reputation
5. Advanced analytics for detecting suspicious voting patterns
6. User interface for easy interaction with the governance system
